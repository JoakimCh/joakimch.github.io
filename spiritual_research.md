# Spiritual research [[back to index]](../)

As in research on consciousness and spiritual phenomena like ESP (extra sensory perception), MOV (mind over matter) / mPK (micro-psychokinesis) and telepathy.

As a software programmer (who knows what consciousness really is) I am actually in a unique position to do lots of research on these things.

My Twitter handle for this is [JLC_Spiritual](https://twitter.com/JLC_Spiritual)


## First a hypothesis

It's my hypothesis that consciousness can manipulate our reality construct. E.g. both your consciousness and the consciousness of anyone who are not in a body (e.g. dead people or other entities).

But that these manipulations usually are very weak/small (depending on the ability of the consciousness in question of course).

And that the easiest thing to manipulate are the things that often go unnoticed. Unless someone is looking that is... E.g. things that appear random, like radioactive decay or other forms of "random noise". That manipulating these things has "less friction" than manipulating "bigger things".

## Projects I'm working on or planning

* Digital ouija board or spirit communicator (using true random data from microphone). With ability to speak words.

* A suite of ESP, telepathy and mPK experiments that people can do together or alone and collect statistics about their success (or lack of).

* Experiments where thousands of people at the same time (through live streams on YouTube) will try to manipulate a live TRNG (true random number generator).

* A random noise / data analyzer that can detect deviations from expected randomness. Will e.g. be used to ensure only usage of most random bits from sound input (e.g. the "noisy part" of any microphone input).

* Using transcription of hundreds of NDE testimonies (from YouTube) to automatically find similar descriptions and experiences. E.g. collecting every clip of people who mention 360Â° vision, etc. And eventually create a documentary about it, one that will prove that near death experiences are a real phenomena describing a very real reality beyond our physical reality.

## Funding and/or cooperation 

To be able to work on these projects I need enough funding to make sure that I don't need to waste my time doing any other work to make my ends meet.

Since I have two kids it will be hard to work any fulltime job in addition to this and at the same time be able to take care of my kids. Hence my goal is to be able to work full time on this!

Hence I would really appreciate anyone who can afford to fund me through the GitHub Sponsors program. [Which you can do here!](https://github.com/sponsors/joakimch)

But I'm also interested in working together with any group who have the same goals as me and who can fund my research. Preferably in Norway (since that's where I'm from), but I'm open for discussion!

## Expectations

I actually expect to eventually prove that consciousness is separate from the brain and that it can manipulate our physical reality. It might be crazy to expect this, but I know that it must be possible to prove it, hence I'll never give up...

Also I know a great deal about how consciousness works and about what our physical reality really is. Hence I'll be able to design experiments with the highest chance of actually proving this.

## Final words

I feel like a "no one" in the "spiritual science community" at the moment. But my work has just started and I hope that over time I will be able to have a bigger network in this community and to be one of the bigger players.

I also do a lot of writing related to science and philosophy (e.g. the metaphysical) and I will eventually have published a lot of articles related to this.

For now I only have this published:

[The Geller Phenomenon](https://joakimch.substack.com/p/the-geller-phenomenon-907b87248fb4) - Featuring an amazing story about my uncle.

But more is coming...
