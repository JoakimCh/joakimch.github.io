# Welcome to my GitHub website
I'm Joakim L. Christiansen a.k.a. JLC and I'm developing open source software.

This is my super simple (because who cares) GitHub website where I'll write something about myself, my projects and what I do...

### Pages
- A story about me and my health (todo)
- [Funding](funding.md) (please support me)
- Project list (todo)
- My way of JavaScript / ECMAScript development (todo)
